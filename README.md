## This is the lunarnova moon-mission license.
# IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONTACT US IF YOU WANT TO HELP US FOR OUR PROJECT. We are coding an system for moon bases at the moment.

## We are also coding software like AIs, some mods for games like minecraft, operating systems, etc.
# We are not uploading our software due to project thiefes.

## We are coding at high speed, ca. 2000 to 4000 lines per week or more.
# Well, that doesn't sound like very much, but you might consider that the rest of my team is caring about the money and plans etc and that I am the only coder in our team at the moment.
